Project 2 - Automatic Headlight Control System

Objectives
Previously, we designed a safety system for a driver's ed car, so that it would not start up unless there was
somebody sitting in the driver’s seat, passenger seat, and that both people had their seat belts buckled.
If any of these requirements were not met, and the ignition button was pressed, the car's alarm system would
sound and it would display an error message. But once all of these requirements were met, a green light would
turn on, indicating that the car could be started, and once the ignition button was pressed, the engine would
start and an “Engine started” message would be displayed. Now, we are modifying this system slightly. If the
requirements to start the car are not met, and the alarm goes off, the user is allowed to try to meet them again.
If the car is turned on, and the ignition button is pressed again, it will turn off the engine, and display a
message saying “Engine Stopped.” We are also adding an automatic headlights system to the driver’s ed car.
Once the car is running it will initiate, and the user will be able to select on (turning both headlights on),
off (turning both headlights off), or auto (which will sense the light outside and turn the headlights on or
off according to the outside light level).
